### Enhanced Technical Specification for Junior Android Developer: Pokedex App

#### Overview
This document presents a comprehensive guide for developing a Pokedex app with an offline-first approach using MVVM architecture. The app features a list of Pokemon and detailed views for each, leveraging modern Android development tools and practices.

#### Architecture: Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)

##### Domain Layer
- **Role**: Encapsulates business logic and data representation.
- **Components**:
  - `Pokemon.kt`: Represents the Pokemon entity with properties like id, name, etc.
  - `GetPokemonsUseCase.kt`: Business logic to fetch a list of Pokemon. It interacts with the repository to retrieve data, providing a clear separation of concerns.
  - `GetPokemonDetailsUseCase.kt`: Fetches detailed information about a specific Pokemon. It abstracts the data-fetching process from the ViewModel.

##### Data Layer
- **Role**: Manages data operations both from the network and local database.
- **Remote**:
  - `PokemonApiService.kt`: Defines the Retrofit API endpoints for fetching Pokemon data from a remote server.
  - `RemoteDataSource.kt`: Acts as a data-fetcher, utilizing `PokemonApiService` to get data.
- **Local**:
  - `PokemonDao.kt`: Interface for the ROOM database, defining methods for local data operations.
  - `LocalDataSource.kt`: Manages local data transactions and queries.
  - `AppDatabase.kt`: ROOM database class that provides DAO instances.

##### Presentation Layer
- **Role**: Responsible for presenting data to the user and handling user interactions.
- **Components**:
  - `PokemonListScreen.kt`: Composable function displaying the list of Pokemon using Jetpack Compose.
  - `PokemonDetailScreen.kt`: Composable function showing detailed information of a selected Pokemon.
  - `PokemonListViewModel.kt` & `PokemonDetailViewModel.kt`: ViewModels managing the state and logic of the respective screens, making API calls through use cases.

#### Technologies & Libraries

##### Dependency Injection with Dagger
- **Purpose**: Manages the dependencies of classes, making the code more modular, testable, and maintainable.
- **Components**:
  - `AppComponent.kt`: Centralized setup for dependency injection.
  - `NetworkModule.kt`: Provides dependencies for network operations, including Retrofit setup.
  - `DatabaseModule.kt`: Supplies dependencies for ROOM database operations.

##### Networking with Retrofit
- **Location**: Part of the `data/remote` directory.
- **Functionality**: Handles all network requests for fetching Pokemon data, converting JSON responses into Kotlin objects.

##### Local Database with ROOM
- **Details**: Implements offline storage, allowing the app to function without an active internet connection.
- **Entity**: Represents the schema for the Pokemon table in the SQLite database.
- **DAO**: Contains methods for reading and writing Pokemon data to the local database.
- **Database**: Singleton class that provides an instance of the ROOM database.

##### UI with Jetpack Compose
- **Usage**: Simplifies UI development with a declarative approach, replacing traditional XML layouts.

#### Testing Strategy
- **JUnit**: For unit testing domain and data layers, ensuring business logic and data handling work correctly.
- **Espresso**: For UI tests, verifying the app's interface behaves as expected under various conditions.

#### File Structure

#### Additional Considerations
- **Offline First**: Prioritizes local data, enhancing user experience in low/no connectivity.
- **Scalability**: Using Dagger and modular design for ease of maintenance and scalability.
- **Test Coverage**: Emphasizes robust testing for reliable app performance.

This enhanced technical specification provides detailed insights into each aspect of the Pokedex app, ensuring a clear and structured approach to development.
